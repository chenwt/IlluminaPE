** System Requirements **

o Python 2.7. Not tested with Python 3.

o BioPython, see http://biopython.org/wiki/Main_Page.


** Installation **

python setup.py install --prefix=<PREFIX>

For example, I like to install it under my home directory with:

python setup.py install --prefix=$HOME

This will build and copy the files to $HOME/lib/python2.7/site-packages/PEassembly.

The scripts will be in $HOME/bin.



** Running PEassembly **

(The examples below assume you are in the test/ directory and PEassembly has been succesfully installed).

To detect and remove primers:

python remove_primers.py -1 test.1.fq.gz -2 test.2.fq.gz -o test --fprimer ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAGT --rprimer GTATTACCGCGGCTGCTGGCAC


To remove read pairs with high number of low Phred scores:

python remove_high_expected_err.py -1 test.Fprimer_good.gz -2 test.Rprimer_good.gz -e 10


test.Fprimer_good.gz.experror_good.gz and test.Rprimer_good.gz.experror_good.gz 
is what you want to use in the next step. However we need to first convert them into FASTQ format,
also rename them into something a little shorter.

python bioconvert.py -i test.Fprimer_good.gz.experror_good.gz b2fq
python bioconvert.py -i test.Rprimer_good.gz.experror_good.gz b2fq
gzip test.*primer_good.gz.experror_good.gz.fq
ln -s test.Fprimer_good.gz.experror_good.gz.fq.gz test_good.1.fq.gz
ln -s test.Rprimer_good.gz.experror_good.gz.fq.gz test_good.2.fq.gz

To align reads using the quicker overlap-finding algorithm:

python composite_overlap_finder.py -1 test_good.1.fq.gz -2 test_good.2.fq.gz -o test_good


To align remaining unaligned reads using the slower BowTie aligner:

python composite_bowtie_aligner.py -1 test_good.overlap.1.unaligned \
                 -2 test_good.overlap.2.unaligned -o test_good


Note that, the input to the overlap-finding script are GZIP fastq files, whereas
BowTie can only take non-compressed fastq files!!


To align the results from overlap-finding, you must first GZIP the output file:

cat test_good.overlap.aligned test_good.bowtie.aligned > test_good.overlapNbowtie.aligned
gzip test_good.overlapNbowtie.aligned

Then run the paired-end assembly script:

python run_composite.py --input test_good.overlapNbowtie.aligned.gz --output test_good.overlapNbowtie.aligned.gz.composite


The output from run_composite.py is in BowTie format which can be converted into FASTA and FASTQ format using the bioconvert.py script. 

gzip test_good.overlapNbowtie.aligned.gz.composite

# this converts BowTie format (gzipped) to FASTA
python bioconvert.py -i test_good.overlapNbowtie.aligned.gz.composite.gz b2f

# this converts BowTie format (gzipped) to FASTQ
python bioconvert.py -i test_good.overlapNbowtie.aligned.gz.composite.gz b2fq
